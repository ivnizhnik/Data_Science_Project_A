Data set: The dataset is the World Happiness Report 2020 by Data World. It consists of 20 columns/features and 153 rows (each row for a country) with zero missing data as well as zero duplicated rows. The brief statistical overview of the dataset provides a healthy start for data exploration and further analysis. The target (y) is the ladder score which is a proxy for happiness level on the scale of 0-10. The other features in the dataset includes things like GDP/capita, freedom levels, corruption levels, etc. all the variables that may impact happiness level.
Preprocessing and Analyses:
- After cleaning the data, checking for consistency, duplication, relevance, outliers, a set of regression analyses were done, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Bagged Tree, and Random Forest.
- Random Forest provided the most accurate prediction power in the test data 
- Social support, healthy life expectency, and Logged GDP/Capita are the most important features according to this analysis in explaining variation in the happiness score.
Initial exploration demonstrated high correlation between social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom levels with the level of happiness
