Data set: The dataset is the World Happiness Report 2020 by Data World. It consists of 20 columns/features and 153 rows (each row for a country) with zero missing data as well as zero duplicated rows. The brief statistical overview of the dataset provides a healthy start for data exploration and further analysis. The target (y) is the ladder score which is a proxy for happiness level on the scale of 0-10. The other features in the dataset includes things like GDP/capita, freedom levels, corruption levels, etc. all the variables that may impact happiness level.
Preprocessing and Analyses:
- After cleaning the data, checking for consistency, duplication, relevance, outliers, a set of regression analyses were done, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Bagged Tree, and Random Forest.
- Random Forest provided the most accurate prediction power in the test data 
- Social support, healthy life expectency, and Logged GDP/Capita are the most important features according to this analysis in explaining variation in the happiness score.
